# ML-Heart-Failure-Prediction

## Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the risk of heart failure in patients based on a dataset. 
The dataset contains clinical data from heart failure patients, including demographic information and various health metrics. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data?page=2

## Algorithms
Logistic Regression<br>
Random Forest Classifier<br>
Decision Tree<br>
XGBoost
